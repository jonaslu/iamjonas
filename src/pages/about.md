## Boring background
I've been coding since early 90-ies.  
I've been coding and getting [paid](https://se.linkedin.com/in/jonashlundberg) for it since mid 00-ies.  
I freelance since 2016 because I get to be my own boss.  
I call my blog-posts articles because it sounds more pompous.  
I have this one-man [melodic death metal](https://www.facebook.com/aestheticsofaloss/) orchestra.  
I've take an a blood oath to choose quality over quantity.
